# Playgrounds



## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Create a new playground file using Xcode.
* Explain that a playground file is not **necessary** to application projects. It's used solely as a place to explore, without the need to create a project.
* Write code in the playground file
* Be familiar with the error message that appears when trying to change a **let** constant.



## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables & constants using `String` literals.


## Outline / Notes

*  Make sure they have Xcode
* Take them through every step in creating a playground file (screenshots are recommended)
* Have them write code in the playground file
* Have them try to change a constant after it has been set to see the error:
